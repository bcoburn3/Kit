Lisp to VBA compiler, intended to help me learn about programming and someday let write extensions for
Autodesk Inventor using Lisp instead of VBA 

Some features, most of which don't yet exist:  
A lisp-1, only one namespace  
Inspired more by Clojure and Scheme than Common Lisp  
Function definitions expand out to def's and lambda's  
Clojure style map/vector notation  
Maps and vectors can be called as functions  
Completely unconcerned with performance, chooses ease of implementation over speed every time
